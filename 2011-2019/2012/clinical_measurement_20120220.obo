comment: This is the term which was just "heart measurement". Since it was under body morphological measurement it seemed to clearly refer to a morphological measurement. I made this term more specific so that another term for "heart measurement" could be added to the ontology above it which would also be a parent to other non-morphological heart-related terms.
