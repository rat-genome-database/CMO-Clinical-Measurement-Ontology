comment: This is the term which was just "heart measurement". Since it was under body morphological measurement it seemed to clearly refer to a morphological measurement. I made this term more specific so that another term for "heart measurement" could be added to the ontology above it which would also be a parent to other non-morphological heart-related terms.

Glucose is the monosaccharide sugar which is the principal circulating sugar in the blood and the major energy source of the body. Fat cells are connective tissue cells specialized for the synthesis and storage of fat; such cells consist of a large cytoplasmic vesicle filled with globules of triglycerides with the nucleus displaced to one side and the cytoplasm seen as a thin line around the fat vesicle."
