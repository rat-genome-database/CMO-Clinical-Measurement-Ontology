comment: This is the term which was just "heart measurement". Since it was under body morphological measurement it seemed to clearly refer to a morphological measurement. I made this term more specific so that another term for "heart measurement" could be added to the ontology above it which would also be a parent to other non-morphological heart-related terms.

name: blood very low density lipoprotein cholesterol level
def: "Measurement of the amount of cholesterol, a eukaryotic sterol that in higher animals is the precursor of bile acids and steroid hormones and a key constituent of cell membranes, carried in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) molecules in a specified volume of blood, the fluid that circulates through the heart, arteries, capillaries and veins carrying nutrients and oxygen to the body tissues and metabolites away from them. VLDL constitute a class of large (e.g. approximately 30-80 nm in diameter) lipoprotein particles, complex molecules that consist of a protein membrane surrounding a core of lipids. The VLDL class of lipoproteins has a density between 0.95 and 1.006 g/ml." [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/, http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/lipoproteins.php]
comment: Values for density ranges of the lipoprotein classes are approximate.  The classes may be defined differently by different researchers, in part because class definitions depend on the number of subclasses into which the lipoprotein fractions are divided.

name: serum high density lipoprotein phospholipid level
def: "Measurement of the amount of phospholipid, any of various phosphorus-containing lipids that are composed mainly of fatty acids, a phosphate group, and a simple organic molecule such as glycerol, carried in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) molecules in a specified volume of serum, the clear liquid that separates from blood after it has clotted completely, i.e. blood plasma from which fibrinogen has been removed. HDL is the smallest of the major lipoprotein particles, complex molecules that consist of a protein membrane surrounding a core of lipids. The HDL class of lipoproteins, specifically the subtypes of HDL2 and HDL3, have densities between 1.063 and 1.210 g/ml." [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/, http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/lipoproteins.php]
comment: Values for density ranges of the lipoprotein classes are approximate.  The classes may be defined differently by different researchers, in part because class definitions depend on the number of subclasses into which the lipoprotein fractions are divided.

name: receptor-dependent blood vessel maximum contractile force to receptor-independent blood vessel maximum contractile force ratio
def: "A calculated measurement in which the receptor-dependent maximum contractile force of a blood vessel is divided by the receptor-independent maximum contractile force of a blood vessel and presented as a ratio, fraction, quotient or percentage. The maximum contractile force of a blood vessel is the highest achievable amount of energy produced by the active reduction in the diameter of a blood vessel, any one of the network of muscular tubes that carry blood through the body, resulting from a contraction of the muscular wall of the vessel.  Receptor-dependent refers to such a contraction which is instigated by the activation of a receptor, a molecule on the surface or within a cell that recognizes and binds with specific molecules, producing a specific effect. Receptor-independent denotes such a contraction that does not involve the action of a receptor."

comment: The term "absolute change" refers to the subtraction of one value from another, as opposed to a dissimilarity of two values expressed as a ratio or as a percentage. In this context it is not intended to necessarily imply the difference expressed as an absolute value |n|, that is, the numeric value of the difference without regard to its sign.

An anti-toxoplasma antibody is an immunoglobulin molecule possessing a specific amino acid sequence that binds to a specific antigen found on or in the parasite toxoplasma, a genus of sporozoa the only species of which is Toxoplasma gondii that are intracellular parasites of many organs and tissues of birds and mammals, including humans. A parasite is an organism that grows, feeds, and is sheltered on or in a different organism while contributing nothing to the survival of its host and possibly causing damage to that host. An antigen is a substance introduced into an organism which initiates an immune response, including the production of the very antibodies which bind to it in an effort to destroy it."

def: "A calculated measurement of the degree to which a change in the size of the remaining kidney after surgical removal of the other kidney can be attributed to compensatory growth, calculated as the ratio of the normalized weight of a single kidney at the time of surgical removal divided by the similarly normalized weight of the single remaining kidney at a specified period of time after removal. The normalized kidney weight is the weight of the kidney corrected for body weight using an empirically determined allometric scaling factor (i.e., an exponential factor which adjusts for the normal increase in kidney weight due to normal growth and development of the individual). Compensatory growth is the phenomenon in which the impaired function of one organ in a paired organ system or of part of an organ in a single organ system is followed by enlargement of the surviving organ or tissue so that functional capacity is maintained. Kidney is the paired organ which functions to maintain proper water and electrolyte balance, regulate acid-base concentration, and filter the blood of metabolic wastes."

def: "The enumeration, i.e. measurement of the total number, of defects or lesions of the internal elastic lamina which are not hyperplastic or neoplastic in origin in a specified sample of artery. A lesion is a localized pathological change in structure of an organ or tissue due to injury or disease; especially one that is circumscribed and well defined. The internal elastic lamina (IEL) is a fenestrated (perforated) layer of elastic tissue, i.e., one having the property of returning to the original shape after being distorted, that is the outermost part of the intima (innermost layer) of an artery. The IEL is the elastic layer that is situated between the tunica intima (inner layers) and tunica media (middle layers) of artery walls. An artery is any one of the branching system of muscular, elastic blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart."

Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is comprised of tumors arising in the tongue from the uncontrolled multiplication of cells of the epithelium, or of cells showing the particular cytological characteristics of squamous cell differentiation, such as the presence of keratin, tonofilament bundles, or desmosomes, structures involved in cell-to-cell adhesion. A tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue resulting from uncontrolled, progressive multiplication of cells and serving no physiological function. The tongue is the movable muscular organ on the floor of the mouth; it is the chief organ of taste, and aids in mastication, swallowing, and speech."

In this context it is not intended to necessarily imply the difference expressed as an absolute value |n|, that is, the numeric value of the difference without regard to its sign.

def: "Any measurement in which the number of individuals in a study population that display hepatocellular carcinoma at a point in time or develop hepatocellular carcinoma within a determined period of time are compared to the total number of individuals in the study population. Often expressed as a percentage but could be expressed as a ratio. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are primary malignant neoplasms of hepatocytes, epithelial liver cells which perform the functions of the liver such as transformation of carbohydrates, synthesis of cholesterol, bile salts and phospholipids, detoxification of exogenous substances, etc. HCC is often associated with cirrhosis and hepatitis B and/or C infection."

def: "A quantitative measure of bone microarchitecture calculated by means of three-dimensional image analysis and based on the volume ratio of plate-shaped trabeculae to rod-shaped ones. For bones which contain both structures the value is expected to be between 0 (all parallel plates) and 3 (all cylindrical rods) although a value of 4 is possible (denoting spherical trabeculae).  Also, where the fraction of mineralized tissue in a bone section is extremely high or low, values outside this 0-4 range are possible." [PMID:11264794, PMID:20533309]

The RDW-SD is an actual measurement of the width of the red cell distribution curve in femtoliters (fL). The width of the distribution curve is measured at the point that is 20% above the baseline. Since the RDW-SD is an actual measurement, it is not influenced by the MCV and more accurately reflects the red cell size variance."
